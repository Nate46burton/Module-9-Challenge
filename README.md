# Overview of the analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to compare the temperature differences in the month of June to the month of December.

# Results

- The mean temperature in the month of June was 74.94 as opposed to 71.04 meaning June was (on average) slightly warmer than December.

- Both months had relatively similar standard deviations with June's being 3.25 and December's being 3.74

- While the maximums for both months were relatively similar (85 and 83), the minimum temperature in June had a much higher difference in temperature than the average between the months. June's minimum temperature was 64 whereas December's was 56.

# Summary 

While the average temperature dipped slightly from June to December, we saw a slightly higher standard deviation in December which is supported by the fact that the minimum in December was much lower than the minimum in June.

I would also write a query to determine the precipitation scores for each month. And then one to to determine if the rain played a factor in temperature difference.
